<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This project is a simple hangman game built using HTML, Vanilla CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.</p>

<p>As you can see, it has quite a simple interface.</p>
<p>From top to bottom, there's a title header, drawing of a hangman, a hint for the word, the word to guess, and a QWERTY style input</p>
<p>You can input your guess by simply clicking on whichever letter you wish to guess</p>

<p>And as you can see, if the word contains the letter that you've guessed, it's reveal the letter in the word</p>
<p>Also the letter you already guessed will be grayed out in the keyboard and you can't press that letter again!</p>
<p>This prevents you from accidently guessing the same letter twice, which although never happens in real life, if done in this application, would actually consider your input incorrect</p>
<em>But what if you're trying to guess the word, but you have no idea what the word might be?<em>
<p>No worries!</p>

<p>If you guess the wrong letters more than three times, the app will give you a hint!<p>

<p>You'll see this message if you correctly guessed the word.</p>

<p>You'll see this message if you failed to guess the word.</p>
<p>But don't worry! You can always try again.</p>
<p>Whether you wont or lost, once you complete a game, the game will automatically restart.</p>
